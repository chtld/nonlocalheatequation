## About

This code implements a distributed non-local heat equation solver using [HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx). This code is mostly used to experiment with new HPX features or
add new features to the non-local models. The latest [documentation](https://nonlocalmodels.github.io/nonlocalheatequation/documentation/) and a [Docker image](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalheatequation/packages/338053) with the latest stable version are available as well.
